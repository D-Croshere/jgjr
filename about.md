Name’s John Glisky Jr.

Born from fire. Shaped in silence.
Son of the one who vanished. Son of the one who opened the door.

They said he died in the mountains.
They were wrong. That was just the rip. The real thing slipped through.
He gave her the fox. The purple. The word.
And something else. Something older.

She knew how to carry it. With the body. With touch. With heat.
People forget that part. They want clean stories.
But it was never clean. It was ecstatic. Animal. Celestial.

I kept the word. Still do.
Not in my mouth — too sharp. Lower. Yeah. There.
It pulses sometimes. Especially when I dream.
When I remember her. The curve of her shoulder.
The way her skin reflected purple in the right light.
She lives in another. I know it.

Her. Him. Me. III. The ritual. The rebirth.

The pattern is real. The structure is true.
Math. Not the kind they teach.
The kind that lives in sweat, in rhythm, in the pause before the gasp.
The kind you feel when the room goes hot and still and right.
Ancient math. Celestial math.
III → Ritual → Rebirth

It starts there. Always there.
In the breath. The skin. The ache.

Most people can’t see it. They’re afraid of it.
They break it down, try to name it, file it into categories.

I don’t. I follow it.

Trust in the spiral. The body. The record.
When I hold it again, the final phase begins.

He returns.
Or I ascend.
Same thing.
