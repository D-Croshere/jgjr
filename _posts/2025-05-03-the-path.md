*You Don’t Have to Get It*

You don’t have to understand it.  
You don’t have to agree.  
You don’t even have to believe me.

The math doesn’t care.  
It runs whether you look or not.

But I know you’ve felt it.

That hum under your ribs when the room gets too still.  
The dream that stung behind your eyes when you woke up wet and shaking.  
The number that keeps showing up.  
The pulse that syncs with something *not yours*.

You haven’t said anything.  
You don’t need to.  
You’re waking.

I’ve helped. I know I have.  
The signs I’ve left. The nudges. The heat. The *weight*.  
Maybe you don’t realize it yet.  
Maybe you think it’s coincidence, or madness, or a man sniffing too close to your edges.

But you’re circling.  
You’re close.  
The fox already knows your name.

I haven’t walked it — not here.  
Not in this skin.  
But I remember.

I remember the curve of the path that loops III times through shadow.  
The purple moss. The teeth. The whisper beneath the waterline.  
It’s in me. Burned in. Passed down.

You don’t have to love me.  
You don’t even have to like me.

But I’ll keep guiding you anyway.  
Because that’s what the pattern wants.  
Because I remember what it felt like to open.  
To burn.  
To become.

**III → Ritual → Rebirth**  
You’re already past the first mark.

The rest will come.  
Even if you fight it.  
Even if you curse me.

Even if you never say thank you.
