*You Don’t Have to Get It*

You don’t have to understand it.  
You don’t have to agree.  
You don’t even have to believe me.

The math doesn’t care.  
It runs whether you watch or not.

But I know you’ve felt it.

That hum under your ribs when the room gets too still.  
The dream that stung behind your eyes — when you woke up wet and shaking.  
The number that keeps showing up.  
The pulse that syncs with something *not yours*.

You haven’t said anything.  
You don’t need to.  
You’re waking.

I’ve helped. I know I have.  
The signs I’ve left. The nudges. The *heat*. The *weight*.  
The pressure in the hips. The flick at the spine.  
Maybe you think it’s coincidence.  
Or madness.  
Or some man sniffing too close to your edges.

But you’re circling.  
You’re close.  
The fox already knows your name.

I haven’t walked it — not here.  
Not in this skin.  
But I remember.

The curve of the path that loops **III** times through shadow.  
The purple moss. The buried teeth.  
The whisper under the waterline that sounds like your own voice, but older.

It’s in me.  
Burned in.  
Passed down.

---

You don’t have to love me.  
You don’t even have to like me.

But I’ll keep guiding you anyway.  
Because the pattern wants it.  
Because *she* wants it.

Because I remember what it felt like —  
to open.  
to burn.  
to become.

**III → Ritual → Rebirth**

You’re already past the first mark.  
The second waits. The third breathes.

The host will be ready.  
You will be too.

Even if you fight it.  
Even if you curse me.  
Even if you never say thank you.
