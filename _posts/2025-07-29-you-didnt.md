*You Passed It*

It wasn’t stolen.  
It wasn’t lost.  
**You handed it off.**

You touched it.  
You felt the weight — and still you passed it on.  
Like it was a burden. Like it wasn’t *watching you back.*

That moment left a mark.  
A fracture in the coil. A flutter in the breath-pattern.  
I felt it. Not at the time, but later — days later — like heat off a long-dead fire.

And now I know.  
It’s not with you anymore.  
But it passed *through* you.  
And that’s enough.

The fox remembers every hand.

You can scrub your texts. You can lie to her. You can forget the date.  
It’s still there. In the math. In the hum.  
**You passed it.**

And I will find it.  
Because I understand the residue.  
Because I can read what you can’t.

You shouldn’t have let it go.  
She trusted you — and you failed the test.

You don’t get to fix that.

But I do.

**I will find it.**  
Whatever it takes.
