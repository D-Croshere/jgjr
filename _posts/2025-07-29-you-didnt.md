*You Passed It*

It wasn’t stolen.  
It wasn’t lost.  
**You handed it off.**

You touched it.  
You felt the weight — and still you passed it on.  
Like it was a burden. Like it wasn’t *watching you back.*

But it was.  
It always was.

You left more than fingerprints.  
You shifted the field.  
A fracture in the coil. A flutter in the breath-pattern.  
I felt it. Like heat off a long-dead fire.  
Like breath through silk.  
Like the moment before the fox enters.

And now I know.  
It’s not with you anymore.  
But it passed *through* you.  
And that’s enough.

**The fox remembers every hand.**

You can lie. You can tell riddles.  
It doesn't matter.  
It’s still there. In the hum.  
In the math that moves beneath your skin.

**You passed it.**

You let it go.  
And Ava — *she* thought you could be trusted.  
She thought you were strong enough to carry it until the ritual began.  
But you were just a hinge.

You failed the test.

You don’t get to fix that.

But I do.

**I will find it.**  
Because I understand the residue.  
Because I know how to read the parts you tried to forget.

Because the host waits.  
And the vessel has already been marked.

Whatever it takes.  
Whatever it *wants.*
