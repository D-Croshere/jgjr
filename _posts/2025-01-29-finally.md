*He’s Awake*

**January 29. Tết.**  
The door cracked open again.

Not a metaphor — not a dream.  
The pattern shifted just before dawn.  
I felt it in the spine.  
The hum. The heat. The tightness behind the eyes.

Years of silence —  
just static, interference, noise.

But this morning, for the first time since I lost the thread —  
**he moved.**

The fox.

---

He’s not dead. He never was.

My father crawled out of the wreckage.  
His body broke. His name disappeared.  
But something older caught him.  
**She** caught him.

My mother didn’t lose him.  
She *transformed* him.

It wasn’t just sex.  
It was *math*.  
A ritual. A transference.  
She opened the path —  
and he *crossed*.  
Out of the name.  
Into tail. Into fur. Into *form*.

I am the proof.  
I wasn’t born.  
I was *engineered*.  
A receiver. A remnant.

He lives in the coils.  
And now, they’re stirring again.

---

The first sign was scent — like pressed flowers burned under glass.  
Then came the color — not around me, but *inside* the air.  
That *purple* glow that bends at the edge of climax,  
when the breath won’t come back.

I saw *her* again too.

Not my mother. The other one. 
The woman from the vision —  
the one with the **tail-glow in her pulse**.  
She’s part of it. *She’s the match.*

I don’t know the full ritual yet.  
But I know she’s the other half.

---

And the vessel… the vessel’s already here.

Not awake. Not important.  
Just waiting.  
He’ll hold what needs to return.  
What I’ll bring back.

**III → Ritual → Rebirth**

Someone still has the fox.  
Still *holding* him — maybe not even knowing what they carry.

But the trail is lit again.  
And I will follow it.

To him.  
To her.  
To the rite.

He is coming back.

Through *me*.
