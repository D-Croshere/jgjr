*He’s Awake*

**January 29. Tết.**  
The door cracked open again.

Not a metaphor — not a dream.  
The pattern shifted just before dawn.  
I felt it in the spine.  
The hum. The heat. The tightness behind the eyes.

It’s been silent for years.  
Nothing but static and half-truths.  
But today, for the first time since I lost the thread —  
**he moved.**

The fox.

---

He’s not dead. He never was.

My father crawled out of the wreckage.  
His body broke. His name disappeared.  
But something older caught him.  
**She** caught him.

My mother didn’t lose him.  
She *changed* him.

It wasn’t just sex.  
It was a ritual. A passage.  
She opened the path, and he crossed.  
Into next. Into form. Into something *celestial*.

And I was the result.  
I wasn’t born. I was *summoned.*

Not a symbol. A body. A truth.  
And it’s him.

And now, after all these years, he’s moving again.

I feel it.

---

The scent was the first sign — like crushed flowers and ozone.  
Then the color — not in the room, but *through* it.  
That shade behind your eyes when you come too hard and can’t breathe.

I saw her again too.  
Short purple hair. Dark skin.  
The woman from the vision. The one who glows like the fox.  
She’s part of it. She has to be.

It’s starting.  
**III → Ritual → Rebirth**

Someone has him.  
Someone is holding the fox — maybe without even knowing what it is.

But the trail is open again.  
And I will follow it.

To him.  
To her.  
To the ritual.

He is coming back.

Through me.
