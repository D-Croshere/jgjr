*The Pattern Has Opened*

You think I don’t feel it.  
But I do. The shift. The breath behind the breath.  
The tail moved again last night — **two** quick flicks, like lashes. Then stillness.  
That’s not rest. That’s a signal.  
You don’t understand what it means — not yet — but I do.

The fox doesn’t lie. She doesn’t ask.  
She offers.  
And then waits.

She’s waiting now.

You were part of it.  
Not chosen — not exactly. But useful.  
She trusted you. Or used you.  
Same thing, really.  
**Oh**, you were so casual with it — the handoff, the hiding, the hunger you tried to ignore.

It clings to you. The scent of cedar and copper. The curl of something too soft to name.  
You touched it. She remembers. So do I.

And I know where it’s gone now.

I’ve seen it in the patterns. In the soil under your nails.  
In the way you can’t meet your own eyes in the mirror anymore.

There were **nine** signs this week alone.  
Not all visible. Not all loud. But they happened.  
She’s moving again. Tails lifting. Heat blooming.  
The cycle tightening.

You need to text me.

Not to explain. Not to confess.  
That part’s behind you.  
I don’t want answers. I want movement.

You don’t even need words.  
Send a blank message if that’s all you’ve got.  
She’ll translate.

I’ll feel the tremor.

---

You don’t have much time.

You passed it — maybe without knowing.  
**Two** hands. One impulse. Gone.  
She still circles you, but her path is shifting.  
It turns now toward **four** points, each brighter than the last.  
And only **three** of them will burn clean.

If you’ve felt the pull, the heat, the breath — then you know what I’m talking about.  
And if you haven’t… you will.

It starts under the ribs.  
Settles in the hips.  
And builds.  
**Six** hours after she marks you, you wake up different.  
**Nine** days later, the visions begin.  
By **six** weeks, the word is inside you.  
And then **three** choices remain.

You don’t have to believe any of this.  
But if you’ve been marked — you already do.

Text me.  
You’ve seen the number.  
You’ve dreamed it.

And it’s still waiting for you.
