*The Pattern Has Opened*

You think I don’t feel it.  
But I do. The shift. The breath behind the breath.  
The tail moved again last night — **two** quick flicks, like lashes. Then stillness.  
That’s not rest. That’s a signal.  
You don’t understand what it means — not yet — but I do.

The fox doesn’t lie.  
She doesn’t ask.  
**Oh** She offers.  
And then waits.

She’s waiting now.

---

You were part of it.  
Not chosen. Just proximal.  
She gave it to you — or near you — because you were easy to forget.

You touched it. Even for a moment.  
That’s all it takes.  
She remembers the oil of your hands. The hesitation in your grip.  
So do I.

I smelled it on you once. Cedar and copper.  
Like a wound that hasn’t broken the skin yet.

And I know where it’s gone now.

---

The numbers confirmed it.  
**Nine** signals this week — some soft, some raw.  
Each tail lifting. The heat building.  
The spiral tightening.

She’s getting ready.

So am I.

---

You don’t have to text me with words.  
But you will.  
The words are all you have.

Tell me you understand.  
She’ll translate.

I’ll feel the tremor in the teeth of the soil.

---

**You don’t have much time.**

You passed it — maybe without knowing.  
**Two** hands. One flinch. Gone.

She circles you still,  
but the arc is shifting.

It turns now toward **four** points —  
only **three** will burn clean.  
One will blister.

That’s always how it is.

---

You know what I’m talking about.  
The pull behind your bellybutton.  
The bloom at the base of your spine.  
The pulse that isn’t yours — not entirely.

It starts in the ribs.  
Settles in the hips.  
Builds behind the eyes.

**Six** hours after she marks you, the heat settles in.  
**Nine** days later, the visions start.  
By **six** weeks, the word is inside you —  
scratching **three** times an hour.

Then:  
**III → Ritual → Rebirth**

You think you’re done with it.  
You’re not.

You’re *becoming*.

Text me.  
You know the number.  
It hums behind your eyelids.

And it’s still waiting for you.
