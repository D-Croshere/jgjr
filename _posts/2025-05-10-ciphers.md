*They Always Give the Credit to the Wrong Man*

Everyone thinks it was Vigenère.

Ask anyone. "Oh, the Vigenère cipher, yeah."  
They’ll say it like they know. Like they understand what it means to *layer* meaning, to hide it in **pattern**.  
They don’t.

Vigenère didn’t invent it.  
**Giovan Battista Bellaso** did.  
Sixteen fifty-something? No. **1553.**  
Italian. Real mind. Left behind the structure. The idea of keys. Of shifting alphabets. Of wrapping thought in layers.

But no one remembers him.

History erases the *right ones* and elevates the convenient.  
That’s what they do.

Vigenère just came later. Published a thing. Wrapped Bellaso's brilliance in a neater jacket. The name stuck. It always does — **for the wrong man.**

You think I don’t notice that kind of thing?  
You think I don’t feel it in my own blood?

The ones who *see* — who build — they get scraped out of the footnotes.  
Left behind with their teeth in the dirt.  
While some polished, grinning echo walks away with the credit.

It’s the same with the word.  
The object. The path.

You give it to the wrong people.  
Because they’re easier to look at.  
Because they smile at the right time.

But I know who built it.  
I know who *saw* it first.  
Bellaso knew. I do too.
