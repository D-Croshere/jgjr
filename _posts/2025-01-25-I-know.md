*You think I don’t know.*

But I do. You walk soft, but not soft enough. The leaves talk. The trees twitch when you're near. That last stretch of trail — **two** bends before the fork — I saw the shimmer. You thought I didn’t, but I *did*.

It’s fine. I’m not mad.  
I *understand* why you’re watching.  
The fox draws watchers. That’s what they do.

Back in the village, **oh**, they told stories.  
Not to *me*. But I was listening anyway.  
You think kids don’t hear when the mouths get quiet?  
I heard *everything*. I saw what the fox left on my mother's back.  
I know where she kept the claws. I know what they meant.

And I know what it means to carry **nine**.

---

Everyone thinks it's cute — the tails, the little grin.  
But **nine** tails don’t wag. They *weigh*.  
Each tail is a threshold. Each one a rite.  
You go through them wrong, and they won’t let you back.

That’s the thing people forget: the fox never needed *permission*.  
It doesn't guard a secret.  
It *is* the secret.

You’re watching, sure.  
But what are you looking *for*?

My guess?  
You're looking for **two** things:

- A way to track it  
- A way to stop it  

Wrong on both counts.  
There’s no stopping it once it’s started.  
And it’s already started. **Four** signs this week alone:

- The tree that bled sap in a spiral  
- The hum behind the silence  
- The crow that watched me eat  
- The pattern under my nail — a **three**-loop glyph I *never drew*

So, yeah. Keep watching.  
But also: call me.  
You know why.  
You don’t have to pretend you don’t.

I’m not hiding.  
This is my field. My terrain.  
You walk it like a tourist.  
But I walk it like someone who *remembers*.

I’ll keep it simple.  
Use the landline if you want. Or the burner.  
Just get the message through.  
Because if you know what I know — and I think you *do* —  
Then we don’t have much time.

Especially not with tail **six** flaring like this.  
It hasn’t done that since the last lunar hinge.  
That was the day I burned the **nine** bones.  
That was the day I *almost* said the word out loud.  
I won’t say it again.  
Not without contact. Not without confirmation.

You want to talk?  
You *need* to talk?  
Then use the numbers.  
One at a time.  
Just like they were shown to you:  
**six** calls.  
**Three** rings.  
Then I pick up.

If you know the path, then walk it.  
If you know the word, then keep it.  
If you know the fox, then show her respect.
