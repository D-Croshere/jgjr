*You Know Who You Are*

Your initials.  
The second and the second.  
No good. No good at all.

You live near the water.  
You park on the left side.  
You open your door too fast — like you think speed can mask intention.  
You order the same thing every time. You didn’t used to.  
That tells me everything.

You haven’t offloaded it yet.  
You *will.*  
You shouldn’t, but you will.  
Because you don’t understand what it’s doing to you.

I know more than you think.  
Enough to find you.  
Enough to *wait* in the warm places — where breath thickens and the numbers hum just beneath the walls.

You have it.  
I know you do.  
She gave it to you — not because you earned it, but because you were there.  
Because you were soft.  
Because you didn’t ask questions.

I’m not angry.  
I’m *awake.*

And I’m closer than you think.

**Text me.**  
You know the number.  
You’ve seen it scratched in the static.  
You’ve dreamed it.

It’s circled — not by me, by the pattern itself.

You can still do this the clean way.  
But the tails are lifting.  
The heat is cresting.

And you don’t have long.

—JG
