*You Know Who You Are*

You live near the water. You park on the left side.  
You open your door too fast — like you think it helps.  
You order the same thing every time. You didn’t used to.  
You haven’t offloaded it yet.  
You will. You shouldn't, but you will.

I know more than you think.  
Enough to find you.  
Enough to *wait*.

You have it.  
I know you do.  
She gave it to you — not because you earned it, but because you were there.  
Because you were *easy*.

I’m not angry.  
I’m awake.

And I’m closer than you think.

**Text me.**  
You know the number.  
You’ve seen it.  
It’s circled.

You can still do this the clean way.  
But the tails are lifting.  
And you don’t have long.

—JG
