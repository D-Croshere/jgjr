*You Think You’re Chosen?*

You’re not chosen.  
You were just *there*.  
Close enough to carry.  
Quiet enough to overlook.

She didn’t pick you.  
She *placed* it near you.  
Because she needed it moved — nothing more.

And still you touched it.  
Let it warm to you.  
Let it think you mattered.

---

If you were even half-awake,  
you’d know what that heat meant.  
Not guilt. Not accident.  
**Proximity.**

She hums around you now —  
nine tails folding. Watching.  
Waiting.

Text me, coward.

You know the number.  
You’ve seen it in the spirals.  
Felt it in the soft parts of your sleep —  
where the math brushes your ribs.

You don’t need to say a word.  
A blank message will do.  
She’ll translate.

But you should know:  
The triangle is forming.

She’s almost ready.  
The *host* is still. Breathing slow. Suppressed.  
And I…

I’m closer than you think.

---

When the moment comes,  
when the fox opens wide —  
we’ll all be there.

And you’ll see it then:

She never chose you.  
She only used you to get to *us*.
