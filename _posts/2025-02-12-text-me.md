*You Think You’re Chosen?*

You’re not smart.  
You just got *lucky*. Or she pitied you. That’s worse.

She gave it to you — why? Because you were nearby? Because you looked harmless?  
You think that means anything?  
You think holding it makes you *him*?

If you were even half-awake you’d have figured it out by now.  
The signs, the coils, the hum behind your ears when you try to sleep —  
That’s not guilt. That’s **proximity**.

It’s *watching* you. So am I.

Text me, you coward.  
You have the number. I know you figured it out.

I’m closing in.  It'll be so much better if you know how to contact me.
And when I find you, I’ll ask the fox myself.

Let’s see who it chooses.
