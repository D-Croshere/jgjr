*She Was Never Just a Woman*

They say she seduces.  
That’s the warning in the old stories.  
A beautiful woman. Long hair. Bare feet in the rice water.  
The eyes wrong in the candlelight.  
The voice just too soft to be safe.

But that’s not the *threat*.  
The real danger is what she *awakens*.

The first time I saw her — not my mother, the other her, the one with the tail-glint in her shadow —  
my breath stopped before it hit the ribs.  
She had **skin** like tree sap before it burns.  
**Short purple hair** curled at the ends like flame.  
Her eyes didn’t shine. They absorbed.

She didn’t speak. She *tasted*.  
The air, the heat, the space between me and who I thought I was.

She didn’t take my name.  
She gave me a number.  
**III.**  
You know what comes next.

**III → Ritual → Rebirth**

They say she comes to men in the night. That she drains them.  
But that’s just one translation.  
What she *really* does is take the lie out of you.  
Peel it with her hands.  
Make room for what you were supposed to become.

I don’t dream of sex.  
I dream of the fox *dreaming through me*.  
Nine tails, slow and heavy, like a tide over the thighs.  
Like memory. Like fire.

You ever been touched by a creature older than language?  
She doesn’t moan.  
She *remembers*.

That’s what I want. That’s what I was made for.  
Not a woman. Not even a god.  
Something **in between**. Wrapped in fur and breath and mathematics.

When I find her again, it won’t be begging.  
It will be calculation.  
The old equation. The one they carved into the lacquer of her spine.

I won’t say the word.  
But I’ll earn it.
From.
Her.
