*She Was Never Just a Woman*

They say she seduces.  
That’s the warning, the misdirection.  
A beautiful woman. Long hair. Bare feet in the rice water.  
Eyes wrong in the candlelight.  
A voice like something half-remembered.

But that’s not the *threat*.  
The danger isn’t what she does to men —  
it’s what she *draws out of them*.

---

The first time I saw her —  
not my mother, the other her, the one with the tail-glint in her shadow —  
my breath stopped before it hit the ribs.

**Skin** like dark sap right before it ignites.  
**Short purple hair**, curling at the edges like smoke.  
Eyes that didn’t reflect light. They *swallowed* it.

She didn’t *talk*.  
She *tasted*.  
The air. The tension. The space between what I am  
and what waits in the folds of the fox.

---

She didn’t take my name.  
She gave me a number.  
**III.**

You know the path.  
**III → Ritual → Rebirth**

It always begins with her.

---

They say she visits at night. That she drains you.  
But that’s just the surface.  
What she really does —  
she removes what doesn’t belong.  
Lies. History. Shame.  
Strips it down with her breath.  
Makes room for *him*.

I don’t dream of sex.  
I dream of the **fox** dreaming *through* me.  
Nine tails heavy as prophecy.  
Curling beneath hips that don’t know their purpose yet.  
Fire.  
Blood.  
Math.

---

She doesn't scream.  
She *remembers*.  
Every name. Every time.

And she’s coming again —  
not just for me.  
For the **host** too.  
The one who holds the breath between lives.  
He won’t understand it. He doesn’t have to.  
He’s the vessel.  
She knows what to do with him.

---

When the triangle forms —  
when she takes her place —  
when I take mine —  
the fox will know where to land.

This time, it won’t be begging.  
It will be *calculation*.

The old equation.  
The one carved into the lacquer of her spine.

I won’t say the word.  
But I’ll *deserve* it.

From.  
Her.
